An interleaving method in a mobile communication system is provided. The interleaving method includes encoding a plurality of bits to output encoded bits in a sequence, interleaving the encoded bits based on a modulation order to generate interleaved encoded bits comprising consecutive bits having a size based on the modulation order, the consecutive bits corresponding to consecutive bits of the encoded bits, scrambling the interleaved encoded bits with a scrambling code to generate scrambled bits, and modulating the scrambled bits based on the modulation order to output at least one symbol.
A method for performing a Discontinuous Reception (DRX) operation by a connected mode User Equipment (UE) in a mobile communication system. The method includes waking up at a wake-up timing, and determining whether an incoming data indication is received from a Node B; reestablishing uplink synchronization upon receipt of the incoming data indication; and waking up after sleeping for a time from the incoming data indication reception timing, receiving a transmission resource allocation message from the Node B, and receiving downlink data over allocated transmission resources.
An apparatus and method are provided for operating Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) in a mobile communication system. The method includes receiving a number of HARQ processes of a persistent resource allocation and persistent resource allocation interval information; receiving data according to the persistent resource allocation interval information; calculating a HARQ process IDentifier (ID) using the number of HARQ processes of the persistent resource allocation, the persistent resource allocation interval information, and time information; and associating a HARQ process with the calculated HARQ process ID.
Reliable detection of the configuration of transmit antennas includes obtaining a data for transmission, encoding the data, and modulating the data. During the modulating of the data, the data may be configured in such a way as to convey the configuration of the antennas through the modulation of the data. An antenna configuration is obtained by obtaining a representation of the antenna configuration, and masking the data with an error correcting code, where the mask corresponds to the antenna configuration.
A control channel transmission/reception method and an apparatus for transmitting/receiving control channels using a resource allocation scheme applicable regardless of reference signal transmission or whether the reference signal is transmitted in distributed transmission mode or localized transmission mode are provided. The control channel transmission method includes mapping a Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) to Resource Elements (REs) of a Resource Block (RB) for transmitting a control channel, mapping the control channel to the REs numbered with numbers of predetermined number of Resource Element Groups (REGs) in a frequency-first ascending order cyclically, with the exception of the REs to which the DMRS is mapped, and transmitting the DMRS and the control channel.
An apparatus and method for performing cell selection to a Home cell or a Private network in a mobile communication system are provided, in which a User Equipment (UE) determines a candidate cell by measuring a serving cell and neighbor cells, receives an indicator indicating a Home cell or a Private network in system information from the candidate cell, determines whether the candidate cell is included in a Home cell or Private network list set in the UE, and selects the candidate cell if the candidate cell is included in the Home cell or Private network list.
