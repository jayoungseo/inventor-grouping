In a display apparatus, a light guide plate includes a chamfered corner portion that defines a light incident surface. A light source unit is arranged adjacent to the light incident surface to provide the light to the light guide plate through the light incident surface. A display panel receives light from the light guide plate to display an image. A receiving container includes sidewalls and a bottom portion to accommodate the light guide plate and the light source unit. At least one sidewall adjacent to the corner portion is divided into a first part and a second part that may be coupled to or separated from each other. Thus, the light guide plate and the light source unit may be easily accommodated in the receiving container, thereby improving an assembling efficiency.
