A nonvolatile memory device includes a substrate, a channel layer protruding from the substrate, a gate conductive layer surrounding the channel layer, a gate insulating layer disposed between the channel layer and the gate conductive layer, and a first insulating layer spaced apart from the channel layer and disposed on the top and bottom of the gate conductive layer. The gate insulating layer extends between the gate conductive layer and the first insulating layer.
A test system for debugging a target device includes a switch unit configured to transfer a test signal to the target device, the target device including a first intellectual property (IP) block supporting a debugging operation at a normal mode and a second IP block supporting a debugging operation at a power saving mode. The switch unit is configured to form a first signal transfer path for transferring the test signal to the first IP block at the normal mode and to form a second signal transfer path for transferring the test signal to the second IP block at the power saving mode.
