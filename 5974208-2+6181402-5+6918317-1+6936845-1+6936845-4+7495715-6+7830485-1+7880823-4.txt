In a display apparatus having a plurality of pixel parts, each pixel part receives a data signal in response to a present gate signal and charges first and second pixel voltages having the same voltage level. A plurality of voltage controllers includes a level-down part to lower a voltage level of the second pixel voltage using a previous pixel voltage charged in a previous frame in response to a next gate signal and a level-up part to receive the lowered second pixel voltage in response to the next gate signal to boost up a voltage level of the first pixel voltage.
A method for manufacturing a liquid crystal display (
A liquid crystal display includes a first substrate with pixel electrodes, and a second substrate with a common electrode facing the first substrate. The common electrode has depression patterns corresponding to the pixel electrodes. The side wall of each depression pattern is at an angle of 30-120 degrees with respect to the first substrate. The depression patterns of the common electrode are formed through making depression patterns at color filters. In this structure, the liquid crystal display bears wide viewing angle and good picture quality.
