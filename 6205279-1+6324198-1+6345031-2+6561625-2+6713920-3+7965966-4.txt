An induction heating type fusing device and an image forming apparatus including the fusing device. The fusing device includes a magnetic flux generator and a compressing roller outside a fusing belt, first and second fusing rollers and a nip guide inside the fusing belt. The compressing roller compresses against the first and second fusing rollers and the nip guide to form nips, while the fusing belt is disposed between the compressing roller and the first and second fusing rollers and the nip guide.
A heating roller including a resistive heating layer and a fusing device including the heating roller. By separately disposing a plurality of electrodes in an axis direction of the heating roller, and by independently controlling each electrode, the heating roller may correspond to various papers having different sizes. Accordingly, the temperature of the heating roller may be stably controlled.
The apparatus includes a heating roller that generates heat for melting toner attached to a printing medium; a first induction coil that is disposed outside the heating roller and heats the heating roller by using induced current generated according to current flowing through the first induction coil; two second induction coils that are disposed at upper portions of both ends of the first induction coil and heat the heating roller by using induced current generated according to current flowing through the two second induction coils; a power supply unit that supplies current to the first induction coil and the two second induction coils; and a control unit that controls the power supply unit to supply current flowing in the same direction or different directions to the first induction coil and the second induction coils according to the size of paper fed into the heating roller.
