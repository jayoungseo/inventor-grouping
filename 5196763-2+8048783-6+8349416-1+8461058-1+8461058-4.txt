An organic light emitting display device may include a first substrate, a first electrode disposed on the first substrate, a pixel defining layer disposed on the first electrode and the first substrate, an organic light emitting structure disposed on the first electrode, a second electrode disposed on the organic light emitting structure and the pixel defining layer, a second substrate disposed on the second electrode, etc. The pixel defining layer may include a fine uneven structure positioned in the display and the non-display regions. The organic light emitting structure may be substantially uniformly formed on the first electrode through the pixel defining layer having the fine uneven structure, so that an organic light emitting display device may exhibit increased lifetime and may show improved image quality.
In one aspect, an encapsulation sheet, a method of manufacturing an organic light emitting display device using the encapsulation sheet, and an organic light emitting display device is provided. The encapsulation sheet includes a carrier film; and a first sheet formed on the carrier film, wherein the first sheet comprises at least one of tin fluorophosphates glass, chalcogenide glass, tellurite glass, borate glass, and phosphate glass.
A donor substrate includes a base substrate, a light to heat conversion layer, a buffer layer and a transfer layer. The light to heat conversion layer may be disposed on the base substrate. The buffer layer may be disposed on the light to heat conversion layer. The buffer layer may include at least one porous layer having a plurality of pores. The transfer layer may be disposed on the buffer layer.
