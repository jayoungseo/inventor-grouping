There is provided a multilayered ceramic capacitor, including a ceramic body, an active layer including a plurality of first and second internal electrodes alternately exposed through both end surfaces of the ceramic body while having the dielectric layer therebetween, to form capacitance; upper and lower cover layers formed above and below the active layer; first and second external electrodes covering both end surfaces of the ceramic body; a plurality of first and second dummy electrodes extended from the first and second external electrodes; and a plurality of piezoelectric members connecting the first internal electrode and the first dummy electrode or the second internal electrode and the second dummy electrode, inside the active layer, the piezoelectric members having a higher dielectric constant than the dielectric layer.
There is provided a chip type laminated capacitor, including: a ceramic body including a dielectric layer having a thickness equal to 10 or more times an average particle diameter of a grain included therein and being 3 ?m or less; first and second outer electrodes formed on both ends of the ceramic body in a length direction; first and second band parts formed to extend inwardly of the ceramic body in the length direction on a length-width (L-W) plane from the first and second outer electrodes and having different lengths; and third and fourth band parts formed to extend inwardly of the ceramic body in the length direction on a length-thickness (L-T) plane from the first and second outer electrodes and having different lengths.
There is provided a multilayer ceramic capacitor including: a ceramic body; an active layer including a plurality of electrodes formed to be alternately exposed to both end surfaces of the ceramic body; an upper cover layer; a lower cover layer having a thickness greater than that of the upper cover layer; and external electrodes, wherein when a distance from an end portion of the lowermost internal electrode of the active layer to an end portion of the external electrode covering a portion of a lower surface of the ceramic body is E, the shortest distance from the end portion of the external electrode to the lowermost internal electrode of the active layer is T, and a margin of the ceramic body in the length direction is F, 1.2?E/T and 30 ?m?F are satisfied.
