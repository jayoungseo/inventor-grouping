A light emitting diode (
A semiconductor device capable of reducing a thickness, an electronic product employing the same, and a method of fabricating the same are provided. The method of fabricating a semiconductor device includes preparing a semiconductor substrate having first and second active regions. A first transistor in the first active region includes a first gate pattern and first impurity regions. A second transistor the second active region includes a second gate pattern and second impurity regions. A first conductive pattern is on the first transistor, wherein at least a part of the first conductive pattern is disposed at a same distance from an upper surface of the semiconductor substrate as at least a part of the second gate pattern. The first conductive pattern may be formed on the first transistor while the second transistor is formed.
A display substrate includes a transparent substrate, a gate line formed on the transparent substrate, a data line crossing the gate line, a thin film transistor electrically connected to the gate line and the data line, and a pixel electrode. The pixel electrode includes a body electrode section electrically connected to the thin film transistor and a plurality of protruding electrodes protruding from the body electrode section. Each of the protruding electrodes includes a trapezoidal electrode having two sides that are inclined with respect to a protrusion direction that is a lengthwise direction of the body electrode section.
