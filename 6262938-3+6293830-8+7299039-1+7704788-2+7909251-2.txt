A graphene electronic device and a method of fabricating the graphene electronic device are provided. The graphene electronic device may include a graphene channel layer formed on a hydrophobic polymer layer, and a passivation layer formed on the graphene channel layer. The hydrophobic polymer layer may prevent or reduce adsorption of impurities to transferred graphene, and a passivation layer may also prevent or reduce adsorption of impurities to a heat-treated graphene channel layer.
Provided is a memory card. The memory card includes interconnection terminals for electric connection with an external electronic machine. The interconnection terminals may be spaced from the front side of the memory card by a distance greater than the lengths of the interconnection terminals. Alternatively, the memory card may include other interconnection terminals between its front side and the former interconnection terminals. The former and latter interconnection terminals may be used for electric connection with different kinds of electronic machines.
The graphene electronic device may include a gate oxide on a conductive substrate, the conductive substrate configured to function as a gate electrode, a pair of first metals on the gate oxide, the pair of the first metals separate from each other, a graphene channel layer extending between the first metals and on the first metals, and a source electrode and a drain electrode on both edges of the graphene channel layer.
