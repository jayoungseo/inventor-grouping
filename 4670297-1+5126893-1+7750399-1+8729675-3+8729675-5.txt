Provided are semiconductor devices with a through electrode and methods of fabricating the same. The methods may include forming a via hole at least partially penetrating a substrate, the via hole having an entrance provided on a top surface of the substrate, forming a via-insulating layer to cover conformally an inner surface of the via hole, forming a buffer layer on the via-insulating layer to cover conformally the via hole provided with the via-insulating layer, the buffer layer being formed of a material whose shrinkability is superior to the via-insulating layer, forming a through electrode to fill the via hole provided with the buffer layer, and recessing a bottom surface of the substrate to expose the through electrode.
A semiconductor device includes a plurality of parallel-trenches that are parallel to each other, a plurality of intersect-trenches that are parallel to each other, a plurality of active regions that are confined by the parallel-trenches and the intersect-trenches, a plurality of lower conductive lines that cross the active regions, a plurality of upper conductive lines that are parallel to each other, that cross the lower conductive lines, and that cross over the active regions, and data storage elements connected to the active regions. Each of the parallel-trenches and the intersect-trenches is a straight line. The parallel-trenches cross the upper conductive lines and form a first acute angle with the upper conductive lines. The intersect-trenches cross the parallel-trenches and form a second acute angle with the parallel-trenches.
