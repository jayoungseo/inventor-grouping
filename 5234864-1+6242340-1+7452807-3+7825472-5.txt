A method of erasing a nonvolatile memory device, which includes a plurality of memory blocks each formed of a plurality of strings, includes applying an erase voltage to a well of a selected memory block of the memory blocks, each memory block including at least two dummy cells located between a string or ground selection transistor and memory cells; and applying or inducing different levels of voltages to respective gates of the at least two dummy cells.
A method of fabricating a semiconductor memory device includes alternately and repeatedly stacking sacrificial layers and insulating layers on a substrate, forming an active pattern penetrating the sacrificial layers and the insulating layers, continuously patterning the insulating layers and the sacrificial layers to form a trench, removing the sacrificial layers exposed in the trench to form recess regions exposing a sidewall of the active pattern, forming an information storage layer on the substrate, forming a gate conductive layer on the information storage layer, such that the gate conductive layer fills the recess regions and defines an empty region in the trench, the empty region being surrounded by the gate conductive layer, and performing an isotropic etch process with respect to the gate conductive layer to form gate electrodes in the recess regions, such that the gate electrodes are separated from each other.
A three-dimensional semiconductor memory device may include gap-fill insulating layers extending upward from a substrate, an electrode structure delimited by sidewalls of the gap-fill insulating layers, vertical structures provided between adjacent ones of the gap-fill insulating layers to penetrate the electrode structure, and at least one separation pattern extending along the gap-fill insulating layers and penetrating at least a portion of the electrode structure. The separation pattern may include at least one separation semiconductor layer.
