An oxide thin-film transistor (TFT) substrate that includes: a substrate, a gate line, a data line, an oxide TFT, and a pixel electrode. An oxide layer of the oxide TFT includes a first region that has semiconductor characteristics and a channel, and a second region that is conductive and surrounds the first region. A portion of the first region is electrically connected to the pixel electrode, and the second region is electrically connected to the data line.
A thin film transistor display panel includes a substrate, a gate wire on the substrate and including a gate line and a gate electrode; a gate insulating layer on the gate wire; a semiconductor layer on the gate insulating layer; a data wire including a source electrode on the semiconductor layer, a drain electrode opposing the source electrode with respect to the gate electrode, and a data line; a passivation layer on the data wire having a contact hole exposing the drain electrode; and a pixel electrode on the passivation layer and connected to the drain electrode through the contact hole. The gate wire has a first region and second region where the gate line and the gate electrode are positioned, respectively. The thickness of the gate wire in the first region is greater than the thickness of the gate wire in the second region.
A display panel includes; a lower gate line, a lower data line disposed substantially perpendicular to the lower gate line, a thin film transistor (
