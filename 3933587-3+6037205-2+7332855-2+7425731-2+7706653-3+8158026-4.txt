A method of manufacturing a semiconductor light emitting device, includes forming a conductive film on a surface of a semiconductor light emitting element. Phosphor particles are charged by mixing phosphor particles with an electrolyte having a metallic salt dissolved therein. The semiconductor light emitting element having the conductive film formed thereon is immersed in the electrolyte having the charged phosphor particles. A phosphor layer on the conductive film is formed by electrophoresing the phosphor particles. The conductive film is removed using wet etching.
Disclosed are a phosphor, a method for preparing and using the same, a light emitting device package, a surface light source apparatus, a lighting apparatus using the phosphor, and a display apparatus. The phosphor includes an inorganic compound represented by an empirical formula (Sr, M)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4-x</sub>Ny:Eu, where M is a metallic element, 0<x<4, and y=2x/3.
There is provided a method for preparing a ?-SiAlON phosphor capable of be controlled to show characteristics such as high brightness and desired particle size distribution. The method for preparing a ?-SiAlON phosphor represented by Formula: Si<sub>(6-x)</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>N<sub>(8-y)</sub>:Ln<sub>z </sub>(wherein, Ln is a rare earth element, and the following requirements are satisfied: 0<x?4.2, 0<y?4.2, and 0<z?1.0) includes: mixing starting materials to prepare a raw material mixture; and heating the raw material mixture in a nitrogen-containing atmospheric gas, wherein the starting materials includes a host raw material including a silicon raw material including metallic silicon, and at least one aluminum raw material selected from the group consisting of metallic aluminum and aluminum compound, and at least activator raw material selected from the rare earth elements for activating the host raw material.
