A multilayered ceramic electronic component includes: a ceramic element having a plurality of dielectric layers laminated therein; first inner electrodes formed on the dielectric layers disposed in upper and lower portions in the ceramic element, the width of a portion of each of the first inner electrodes exposed from one end face of the ceramic element being less than that of a portion thereof disposed within the ceramic element; and second inner electrodes formed on the dielectric layers disposed in the middle portion in the ceramic element, the width of a portion of each of the second inner electrodes exposed from one end face of the ceramic element being equal to that of a portion thereof disposed within the ceramic element.
There is provided a multilayered ceramic capacitor, including a ceramic body, an active layer including a plurality of first and second internal electrodes alternately exposed through both end surfaces of the ceramic body while having the dielectric layer therebetween, to form capacitance; upper and lower cover layers formed above and below the active layer; first and second external electrodes covering both end surfaces of the ceramic body; a plurality of first and second dummy electrodes extended from the first and second external electrodes; and a plurality of piezoelectric members connecting the first internal electrode and the first dummy electrode or the second internal electrode and the second dummy electrode, inside the active layer, the piezoelectric members having a higher dielectric constant than the dielectric layer.
There is provided a multilayer ceramic capacitor, and a method of manufacturing the same, the multilayer ceramic capacitor including: a ceramic body; a first internal electrode; a second internal electrode; a first external electrode; a second external electrode; and an insulating layer.
