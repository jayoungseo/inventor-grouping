In a flexible organic light-emitting display device and a method of manufacturing the same, a photolysis layer and an electrostaticity prevention layer are sequentially formed on a carrier substrate, a first flexible substrate is formed on the electrostaticity prevention layer, a display unit is formed on the first flexible substrate, the display unit is covered with the second flexible substrate, and light is irradiated so as to decompose the photolysis layer and to remove the carrier substrate. The formed flexible organic light-emitting display device may have improved flexibility because a flexible substrate is used instead of a typical strong and thick glass substrate. In addition, occurrence of electrostaticity during the separation of the carrier substrate is suppressed by the electrostaticity prevention layer, and thus, damage of the display unit due to electrical impacts is also reduced.
A method of manufacturing an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, the method including forming a frit adhesive layer on an outer edge portion of a display substrate; forming a mold-releasing layer on a support substrate; attaching the frit adhesive layer of the display substrate on the mold-releasing layer of the support substrate; forming an organic light emitting member on the display substrate; and separating a display portion of the display substrate from the mold-releasing layer by cutting an outer edge portion of the display substrate.
A method of manufacturing a display device, the method including forming a first layer on a rigid glass substrate, the first layer having a hydrophobic surface; forming a second layer to be bonded to a rigid thin glass substrate on the first layer to prepare a carrier substrate; bonding the rigid thin glass substrate onto the second layer; forming and encapsulating a display portion on an upper surface of the rigid thin glass substrate; and irradiating a laser beam to delaminate the first layer and detaching the rigid thin glass substrate from the rigid glass substrate.
