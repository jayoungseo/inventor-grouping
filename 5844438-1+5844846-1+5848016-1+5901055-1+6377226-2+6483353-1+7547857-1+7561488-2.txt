In a communication system, data is selectively transmitted using single-ended or differential signaling. The data is transmitted in relation to a plurality of clock signals having different relative phases. When the data is transmitted using single-ended signaling, data on adjacent signal lines undergo logic transitions at different times in relation to the plurality of clock signals.
A semiconductor memory device having an open bitline memory structure from which an edge dummy memory block is removed, the semiconductor memory device includes a memory block, an edge sense amplification block including a first sense amplifier having a first bitline, a first complementary bitline, and a first amplification circuit comprising a first transistor having a first size, a central sense amplification block including a second sense amplifier having a second bitline, a second complementary bitline, and a second amplification circuit comprising a second transistor having a second size different from the first size, a capacitor block electrically connected to the edge sense amplification block.
Disclosed is a method of controlling a deep power down mode in a multi-port semiconductor memory having a plurality of ports connected to a plurality of processors. Control of the deep power down mode in the multi-port semiconductor memory is performed such that activation/deactivation of the deep power down mode are determined in accordance with signals applied through various ports in the plurality of ports.
