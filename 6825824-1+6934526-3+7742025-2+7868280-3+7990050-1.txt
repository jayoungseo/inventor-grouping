A display device and a method of driving the same in which moving image blurring is prevented and a contrast ratio is enhanced by providing a light-emitting element, switching transistors, and a driving transistor with driving signals that include specific voltages at predetermined times, so that the light-emitting element does not emit light for an entire frame and the light output is not influenced by a threshold voltage of the driving transistor.
An organic light emitting display device includes: a display unit including pixels coupled to scan lines and data lines; one or more control lines coupled to the pixels; a control line driver for supplying control signals to the pixels through the control lines; a first power driver for applying a first power having a low voltage level or a high voltage level to the pixels; and a second power driver for applying a second power having a low voltage level or a high voltage level to the pixels, in which each of the pixels includes: an organic light emitting diode (OLED); a driving transistor for controlling an amount of current supplied to the OLED; and an initializing transistor coupled to a gate electrode of the driving transistor and for supplying a reset voltage to the gate electrode of the driving transistor.
