A flat panel display device and a method of manufacturing the same. The method of manufacturing the flat panel display device includes: forming a display on a substrate; preparing an organic layer mask comprising a first mask body, a regulator extending from the first mask body and contacting the organic layer, and a tunnel having a space between the first mask body and the regulator; forming an organic layer covering the display in a region divided by the regulator of the organic layer mask, and condensing a part of the organic layer permeating through the tunnel; preparing an inorganic layer mask; and forming an inorganic layer covering the organic layers formed in the region divided by the regulator through the inorganic layer mask and in the tunnel.
An organic light-emitting display apparatus for selectively realizing circular polarization according to external light conditions, including a substrate; an organic light-emitting device on the substrate; a sealing member on the organic light-emitting device; a phase retardation layer on a surface of the substrate, the organic light-emitting device, or the sealing member; and a linear polarization layer on another surface of the substrate, the organic light-emitting device, or the sealing member, wherein the linear polarization layer is located to be closer to a source of external light than the phase retardation layer, and wherein the linear polarization layer comprises a photochromic material.
An organic light emitting diode (OLED) display device and method of fabrication that includes a substrate having a device region, an outer dam region and an encapsulation region. The encapsulation region includes an inner dam region, an outer dam region and an encapsulation region that correspond to the device region. An encapsulation agent is formed in the encapsulation region of the encapsulation substrate, and filling dams are formed of the same material in the outer dam region and the inner dam region of the encapsulation substrate.
