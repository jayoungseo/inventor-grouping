A semiconductor device may include a first interlayer dielectric layer including a plurality of contacts, a plurality of interconnection patterns disposed on the first interlayer dielectric layer and connected to the contacts, respectively, and a second interlayer dielectric layer disposed on the first interlayer dielectric layer and covering the interconnection patterns. Each of the interconnection patterns may include a first metal pattern, a second metal pattern disposed on the first metal pattern, a first barrier pattern between the contact and the first metal pattern, and a second barrier pattern between the first metal pattern and the second metal pattern. The second metal pattern may expose a portion of a top surface of the second barrier pattern, and the second interlayer dielectric layer may include an air gap between the interconnection patterns adjacent to each other.
A three-dimensional (3D) display apparatus is provided, including an image input device which receives an image and depth information, a multi-view image generator which generates a multi-view foreground image having depth information which is less than a preset depth value, and a multi-view rear ground image having depth information which is equal to or greater than the preset depth value, using the received image and depth information, a multi-view image renderer which performs rendering by arranging the multi-view foreground image according to a first arrangement pattern and the multi-view rear ground image according to a second arrangement pattern, and a display which outputs the rendered multi-view image.
