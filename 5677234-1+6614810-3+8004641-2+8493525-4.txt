A display panel includes an insulation substrate having a display area and a peripheral area, wires disposed on the insulation substrate in the display area, first and second testing lines disposed on the insulation substrate and aligned substantially parallel to each other, and a diode unit disposed between the wires and one of the first testing line and the second testing line. The wires extend from the display area into the peripheral area and through diodes included in the diode unit, and the wires are electrically connected to the one of the first testing line and the second testing line.
A thin film transistor array panel includes: a substrate; a gate line and a storage electrode that are disposed on the substrate; a data line that crosses the gate line and storage electrode line; a thin film transistor that is connected with the gate line and data line; and a pixel electrode that is connected to the thin film transistor. The storage electrode includes a first storage electrode that is parallel to the gate line, second storage electrodes that extend on opposing sides of the data line from the first storage electrode, a connection part that crosses the data line and connects pairs of the second storage electrodes, and a connection bridge that crosses the gate line and connects a second storage electrode to a second storage electrode of an adjacent pixel.
