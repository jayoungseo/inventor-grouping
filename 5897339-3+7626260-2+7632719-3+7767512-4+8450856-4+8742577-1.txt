A method of manufacturing a semiconductor package includes preparing a parent substrate including package board parts laterally spaced apart from each other, mounting a first chip including a through-via electrode on each of the package board parts, forming a first mold layer on the parent substrate having the first chips, planarizing the first mold layer to expose back sides of the first chips, etching the exposed back sides of the first chips to expose back sides of the through-via electrodes, forming a passivation layer on the planarized first mold layer, the etched back sides of the first chips, and the back sides of the through-via electrodes, and selectively removing the passivation layer to expose the back sides of the through-via electrodes.
Semiconductor packages are disclosed. A semiconductor package includes: a first chip that includes a chip region and scribe regions at edges of the chip region, wherein the chip region comprises integrated circuit units and main through substrate vias electrically connected to the integrated circuit units; and a second chip that is bonded onto the first chip. The semiconductor package includes dummy conductive connectors including at least dummy wiring lines, the dummy conductive connectors electrically connected to the main through substrate vias at one end, and not capable of forming an electrical connection at the other end.
A semiconductor package includes a first semiconductor package, a second semiconductor package, and a package-connecting member. The first semiconductor package includes a first substrate, a chip stacking portion disposed on the first substrate and including a plurality of first semiconductor chips, and a first sealant for surrounding the chip stacking portion on the first substrate. The second semiconductor package includes a second substrate, at least one second semiconductor chip disposed on the second substrate, and a second sealant for surrounding the second semiconductor chip on the second substrate. The package-connecting member electrically connects the first semiconductor package and the second semiconductor package. The plurality of first semiconductor chips include a first chip including through silicon vias (TSVs) and a second chip electrically connected to the first chip via the TSVs, and the chip stacking portion includes an internal sealant for filling a space between the first chip and the second chip and extending to a side of the second chip.
