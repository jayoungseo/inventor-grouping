A flat panel display device and a method of manufacturing the same. The method of manufacturing the flat panel display device includes: forming a display on a substrate; preparing an organic layer mask comprising a first mask body, a regulator extending from the first mask body and contacting the organic layer, and a tunnel having a space between the first mask body and the regulator; forming an organic layer covering the display in a region divided by the regulator of the organic layer mask, and condensing a part of the organic layer permeating through the tunnel; preparing an inorganic layer mask; and forming an inorganic layer covering the organic layers formed in the region divided by the regulator through the inorganic layer mask and in the tunnel.
A laser irradiation device and a method of fabricating an organic light emitting display device (OLED) using the same are disclosed. The laser irradiation device includes: a laser source generating a laser beam; a mask disposed below the laser source and patterning the beam and a projection lens disposed below the mask and determining magnification of the laser beam through the mask, wherein the laser beam penetrating the mask has different doses in at least two regions. Thus, the laser irradiation device can maximize emission efficiency and enhance the quality of a transfer layer pattern when an organic layer of the OLED is formed using the laser irradiation device.
An organic light emitting diode (OLED) display and a method of manufacturing the same are provided. The OLED display includes: a display panel assembly including a first substrate having a display area and a mounting area, a second substrate coupled to the display area of the first substrate, and an integrated circuit chip mounted in the mounting area of the first substrate; a cover window disposed opposite the second substrate and the integrated circuit chip and covering the display panel assembly; and an adhesive layer which fills up a space between the second substrate and the cover window, and a space between the mounting area of the first substrate and the cover window.
