A control channel transmission/reception method and an apparatus for transmitting/receiving control channels using a resource allocation scheme applicable regardless of reference signal transmission or whether the reference signal is transmitted in distributed transmission mode or localized transmission mode are provided. The control channel transmission method includes mapping a Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) to Resource Elements (REs) of a Resource Block (RB) for transmitting a control channel, mapping the control channel to the REs numbered with numbers of predetermined number of Resource Element Groups (REGs) in a frequency-first ascending order cyclically, with the exception of the REs to which the DMRS is mapped, and transmitting the DMRS and the control channel.
An apparatus and method are provided for operating Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) in a mobile communication system. The method includes receiving a number of HARQ processes of a persistent resource allocation and persistent resource allocation interval information; receiving data according to the persistent resource allocation interval information; calculating a HARQ process IDentifier (ID) using the number of HARQ processes of the persistent resource allocation, the persistent resource allocation interval information, and time information; and associating a HARQ process with the calculated HARQ process ID.
