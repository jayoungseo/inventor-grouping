Provided are electrical interconnections and methods for fabricating the same. The electrical interconnection may include a substrate including a bonding pad, a solder ball electrically connected to the bonding pad, a solder supporter on the bonding pad, a portion of the solder ball filling the solder supporter, and a metal layer between the bonding pad and the solder supporter, the metal layer having an ionization tendency lower than the bonding pad.
Semiconductor devices are disclosed. The semiconductor device may include a semiconductor substrate having a first surface and a second surface opposite to each other and a pad trench formed at a portion of the second surface, a through-electrode penetrating the semiconductor substrate and protruding from a bottom surface of the pad trench. A buried pad may be disposed in the pad trench and may surround the through-electrode.
Provided are electrical connection structures and methods of fabricating the same. The structures may include a substrate including a bonding pad region provided with a bonding pad and a fuse region provided with a fuse, an insulating layer provided on the substrate and including a bonding pad opening exposing the bonding pad and a fuse opening exposing the fuse region, a connection terminal provided in the bonding pad region and electrically connected to the bonding pad, and a protection layer provided on the insulating layer including a first protection layer provided within the bonding pad region and a second protection layer in the fuse opening.
