An image processing apparatus and a method of processing an image are provided. The image processing apparatus includes a depth estimation unit for estimating a depth of an input three-dimensional (3D) image; a text area detection unit for detecting a text area included in the 3D image; a mask generation unit for generating a text mask for the text area; and a depth correction unit for correcting a depth of the text area based on the estimated depth of the input 3D image and the text mask.
A three-dimensional (3D) display apparatus is provided, including an image input device which receives an image and depth information, a multi-view image generator which generates a multi-view foreground image having depth information which is less than a preset depth value, and a multi-view rear ground image having depth information which is equal to or greater than the preset depth value, using the received image and depth information, a multi-view image renderer which performs rendering by arranging the multi-view foreground image according to a first arrangement pattern and the multi-view rear ground image according to a second arrangement pattern, and a display which outputs the rendered multi-view image.
