A thin film transistor substrate including a thin film transistor having a drain electrode with an electrode portion, which overlaps with a semiconductor layer, and an extended portion, which extends from the electrode portion and has a portion overlapping with a storage electrode or storage electrode line. A passivation layer is arranged on the drain electrode, and it has a contact hole that partially exposes the extended portion of the drain electrode without exposing a step in the extended portion caused by the storage electrode or storage electrode line. A pixel electrode is arranged on the passivation layer and is electrically connected with the extended portion of the drain electrode through the contact hole.
A display panel includes an insulation substrate having a display area and a peripheral area, wires disposed on the insulation substrate in the display area, first and second testing lines disposed on the insulation substrate and aligned substantially parallel to each other, and a diode unit disposed between the wires and one of the first testing line and the second testing line. The wires extend from the display area into the peripheral area and through diodes included in the diode unit, and the wires are electrically connected to the one of the first testing line and the second testing line.
A display apparatus includes a display substrate and a counter substrate. The display substrate includes a first substrate and a plurality of pixel electrodes formed on the first substrate. The counter substrate includes a second substrate facing the first substrate, a common electrode formed on the second substrate, a first spacer formed on the common electrode and making contact with the display substrate, a second spacer having a first gap with the display substrate, a third spacer having a second gap larger than the first gap with the display substrate, and a fourth spacer having a third gap larger than the second gap with the display substrate.
