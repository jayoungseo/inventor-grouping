A digital imaging apparatus and method by which an auto-focus (AF) operation may be effectively performed during capture of a moving image. The apparatus performs the AF operation during the capture of the moving image when it is determined that a lens is appropriate for capturing the moving image based on received lens information and stops the AF operation during the capture of the moving image when it is determined that the lens is inappropriate for capturing the moving image. When the lens inappropriate for capturing the moving image is mounted, the AF operation may be performed using an additional switch or a manual-focus (MF) operation may be performed.
