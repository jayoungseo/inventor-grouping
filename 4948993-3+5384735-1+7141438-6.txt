A memory cell includes a plug-type first electrode in a substrate, a magneto-resistive memory element disposed on the first electrode, and a second electrode disposed on the magneto-resistive memory element opposite the first electrode. The second electrode has an area of overlap with the magneto-resistive memory element that is greater than an area of overlap of the first electrode and the magneto-resistive memory element. The first surface may, for example, be substantially circular and have a diameter less than a minimum planar dimension (e.g., width) of the second surface. The magneto-resistive memory element may include a colossal magneto-resistive material, such as an insulating material with a perovskite phase and/or a transition metal oxide.
Semiconductor memory device having a stacking structure including resistor switch based logic circuits. The semiconductor memory device includes a first conductive line that includes a first line portion and a second line portion, wherein the first line portion and the second line portion are electrically separated from each other by an intermediate region disposed between the first and second line portions, a first variable resistance material film that is connected to the first line portion and stores data, and a second variable resistance material film that controls an electrical connection between the first line portion and the second line portion.
A stacked semiconductor memory device comprises a semiconductor substrate having a functional circuit, a plurality of memory cell array layers, and at least one connection layer. The memory cell array layers are stacked above the semiconductor substrate. The connection layers are stacked above the semiconductor substrate independent of the memory cell array layers. The connection layers electrically connect memory cell selecting lines arranged on the memory cell array layers to the functional circuit.
