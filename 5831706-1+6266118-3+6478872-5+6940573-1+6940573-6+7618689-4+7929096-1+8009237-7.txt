The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display including a pixel electrode including a first subpixel electrode and a second subpixel electrode spaced apart with a gap therebetween, a common electrode facing the pixel electrode, and a liquid crystal layer formed between the pixel electrode and the common electrode and including a plurality of liquid crystal molecules. The first and second subpixel electrodes include a plurality of branches, and each of the first and second subpixel electrodes includes a plurality of subregions. The branches extend in different directions in different subregions.
A method for manufacturing a liquid crystal display (
A liquid crystal display includes a first substrate including pixels, each having a transmissive area and a reflective area, a second substrate, and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the first and second substrates. Each of the pixels includes first and second thin film transistors which output a data signal in response to a first gate signal, a transmissive pixel electrode disposed in the transmissive area and electrically connected to the first thin film transistor to charge a first pixel voltage based on the data signal, a reflective pixel electrode disposed in the reflective area and electrically connected to the second thin film transistor to charge a second pixel voltage based on the data signal, and a voltage controller which controls the first pixel voltage and the second pixel voltage in response to a second gate signal, which is generated after the first gate signal.
