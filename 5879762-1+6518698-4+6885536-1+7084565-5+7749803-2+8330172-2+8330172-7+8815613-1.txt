A thin film transistor array panel includes: a substrate; a gate line and a storage electrode that are disposed on the substrate; a data line that crosses the gate line and storage electrode line; a thin film transistor that is connected with the gate line and data line; and a pixel electrode that is connected to the thin film transistor. The storage electrode includes a first storage electrode that is parallel to the gate line, second storage electrodes that extend on opposing sides of the data line from the first storage electrode, a connection part that crosses the data line and connects pairs of the second storage electrodes, and a connection bridge that crosses the gate line and connects a second storage electrode to a second storage electrode of an adjacent pixel.
Provided is an organic light emitting display device including: a substrate; first electrodes on the substrate; an emission layer on the first electrodes; a second electrode on the emission layer; a pixel defining layer separating the first electrodes corresponding to pixels and defining pixel areas; and a gas collecting layer on the pixel defining layer.
A method of manufacturing a touch sensing panel includes providing a substrate, forming a plurality of first electrodes arranged on the substrate, the first electrodes being separated from each other, forming a photoresist layer on the plurality of first electrodes, forming a plurality of photoresist removing regions positioned to intersect the first electrodes and to be separated from each other on the photoresist layer, and forming a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) element layer and a second electrode layer comprising a plurality of second electrodes on the photoresist layer. The method provides a touch sensing panel capable of being driven at high speed and reduces manufacturing cost and time.
