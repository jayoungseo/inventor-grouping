In a method of designing a printed circuit board, a package capacitance, a package inductance, and a chip capacitance of an actual memory device are calculated. A signal line capacitance and a signal line inductance per unit length of a signal line are calculated based on characteristics of the printed circuit board. A length of the signal line for each pin is determined based on the package capacitance and the signal line capacitance.
Provided is a sound source signal filtering method and apparatus. The sound source signal filtering method includes: generating two or more microphone output signals by combining sound source signals input through a plurality of microphones; calculating distances between the microphones and a sound source from which the sound source signals are emitted by using distance relationships according to frequencies of the sound source signals extracted from the generated microphone output signals; and filtering the sound source signals to obtain one or more sound source signals corresponding to a predetermined distance by using the calculated distances. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain only sound source signals emitted from a sound source at a particular distance from the microphone array among a plurality of sound source signals input through the microphone array.
A three-dimensional semiconductor package and method for making the same include providing a first package layout parameter for a plurality of first terminals included in a first package, a second package layout parameter for a plurality of second terminals included in a second package disposed above or below the first package, and a connection terminal layout parameter for a plurality of connection terminals electrically connecting the first package and the second package; providing a first wiring connection layout between the first and second terminals and the connection terminals by applying a first process to the first package, second package, and connection terminal layout parameters; and providing a second wiring connection layout between the first and second terminals and the connection terminals by applying a second process, which is different from the first process, to the first wiring connection layout.
